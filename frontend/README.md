## 🎨 Customizing Your Experience: Tailoring the Cosmos 🎨

### Shadcn UI Configuration

Quick Deploy comes pre-configured with Shadcn UI, giving your project a professional and modern look. You can tailor the appearance further by modifying `components.json`:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": false,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "tailwind.config.js",
    "css": "src/index.css",
    "baseColor": "stone",
    "cssVariables": true,
    "prefix": ""
  },
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide"
}
```

### Tailwind CSS

Tweak your application's style by editing `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
export default {
  // ... (rest of your config)
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        // ... your custom colors
      }
    }
  }
};
```

## 🌐 ESLint: Your Code Quality Guardian 🌐

Our ESLint configuration (`eslint.config.js`) keeps your code in stellar shape:

```javascript
import js from '@eslint/js';
import globals from 'globals';
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks';
import reactRefresh from 'eslint-plugin-react-refresh';
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint';

export default tseslint.config(
  { ignores: ['dist'] },
  {
    extends: [js.configs.recommended, ...tseslint.configs.recommended],
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2020,
      globals: globals.browser,
    },
    plugins: {
      'react-hooks': reactHooks,
      'react-refresh': reactRefresh,
    },
    rules: {
      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
      'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
        'warn',
        { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
    },
  },
);
```

Feel free to fine-tune these rules to match your team's coding style!

## 🚀 Deployment Simulation: A Glimpse into the Future 🚀

Quick Deploy allows you to simulate the deployment process locally. By entering a GitHub repository URL in the `Landing` component, you can test how your application will be deployed. It then sets up an interval to check the status every 3 seconds, mimicking a real-world deployment pipeline. When the status changes to 'deployed', it clears the interval and displays the status.

```typescript
// Simplified example from Landing.tsx
const BACKEND_UPLOAD_URL = "http://localhost:3000";
const interval = setInterval(async () => {
  const response = await axios.get(
    `${BACKEND_UPLOAD_URL}/status?id=${res.data.id}`
  );
  if (response.data.status === "deployed") {
    clearInterval(interval);
    setDeployed(true);
  }
}, 3000);
```
