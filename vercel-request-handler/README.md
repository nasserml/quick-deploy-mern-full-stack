## 🔮 Project Overview 🔮

The **Vercel Request Handler** is a pivotal component designed to replicate the behavior of Vercel's edge network. It allows you to deploy websites with unique subdomains directly from Firebase Storage. Think of it as your own galaxy of web servers, efficiently routing requests and delivering content to users across the universe! 🌠

### How It Works

1. **Intercepts Requests**: Listens for incoming requests to your deployed applications.
2. **Identifies the Destination**: Extracts the unique identifier (like a star's unique signature) from the hostname to determine which application should handle the request.
3. **Retrieves the Content**: Fetches the requested files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from Firebase Storage, your cosmic repository of data.
4. **Delivers with Speed**: Serves the content to the user with the appropriate content type, ensuring a smooth and immersive experience.

---

## ✨ Features ✨

- **Serverless Deployment**: Leverage Firebase Storage for hosting static assets without the need for a traditional server.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Handle multiple subdomains dynamically, allowing for scalable multi-tenant applications.
- **TypeScript Support**: Enjoy the benefits of strong typing, making your code robust and maintainable.
- **Express Middleware**: Utilize the power of Express.js for routing and middleware functionality.
- **CORS Enabled**: Secure cross-origin resource sharing, ensuring your APIs are accessible when they need to be.
- **Environment Configuration**: Easily manage sensitive data with environment variables.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack 🛠️

This project shines bright with a constellation of powerful technologies:

- **TypeScript**: Adds strong typing to JavaScript, making the code robust and easier to navigate.
- **Express.js**: A minimalist and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features.
- **Firebase**: A comprehensive app development platform by Google.
  - **Firebase Storage**: For storing and serving user-generated content.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
- **CORS Middleware**: Enables secure cross-origin requests.
- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file, keeping configurations centralized and secure.

---

## 🚀 Prerequisites 🚀

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js** installed on your machine. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- **npm** (Node Package Manager) comes with Node.js.
- A **Firebase Project** with Firebase Storage enabled. Create one [here](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

## 📦 Installation & Setup: Prepare for Launch! 🚀

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nasserml/quick-deploy-mern-full-stack.git
   cd quick-deploy-mern-full-stack/vercel-request-handler
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Firebase**

   - Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable **Firebase Storage** for your project.
   - Retrieve your Firebase configuration (API key, auth domain, etc.) from your project settings.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   - Create a `.env` file in the root of the `vercel-request-handler` directory.
   - Populate the `.env` file with your Firebase configuration:

     ```env
     FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
     FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
     FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
     FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
     FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
     FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
     FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
     ```

     **Note**: Replace the placeholder values with your actual Firebase configuration values. Keep this file secure and do not commit it to version control.

## 🏃 Usage: Ignite the Engines! 🔥

To start the server and embark on your deployment journey, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will compile the TypeScript code and start the Node.js server using `nodemon` for automatic reloads. You'll see a message like this in your console:

```
[nodemon] 2.0.15
[nodemon] to restart at any time, enter `rs`
[nodemon] watching path(s): *.*
[nodemon] watching extensions: ts,json
[nodemon] starting `ts-node src/index.ts`
Server is running on port 3001
Connected to Firebase Storage
```

### Accessing Your Application

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3001
```

You can also test with different subdomains by modifying your `hosts` file or using tools like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) or [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.github.io/www/).
